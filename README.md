# TestNG-project-example


An example of a TestNG framework, how to run multiple tests all together without losing time.
The example has to do with a loan.(personal loan,car loan)

You can see how to run a few tests with the framework even if you have 100 test cases.

There are annotations for test cases, running before the the main test cases, or after the main test cases.

You can also see the xml files.

This framework is only for education purpose and forgive me if you see many errors, i'm just trying to learn. 
Thanx! Enjoy.



You can also see the reports from the test cases  by clicking to test-output --> index.html
                                        and then clicking to failed results or pass results.
                                        There you will find everything into a report.
